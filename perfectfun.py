# Perfect Number?
# A perfect number is the one which is equal to the sum of all it's factors(including 1 and excluding itself).

# Define a function named perfect() which takes one argument(integer) and checks if it is a perfect number or not. Now use this code to write a program that prints all the perfect numbers between 1-1000.
